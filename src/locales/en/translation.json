The game developed (called CS50 Jelly) was made in Unity, it is a puzzle game that consists of completing a series of levels by driving a ball with the mouse by clicking the ball and dragging the mouse such as the launching mechanics in angry birds game. By right-clicking, the ball changes its material which will be necessary for some levels. CS50 Jelly consists of five levels that increase in difficulty. In this way, the game has a cohesive start-to-finish experience for the player when the player completes the last level. The player has some loss conditions such as when the ball collides with the spikes or falls out the stage, the player then will lose and repeat the level. Once the player completes the last level, a congratulations screen will appear for completing the game. However, the user can repeat any level to achieve the maximum score in all levels (3 stars) by reaching the goal with the minimum number of possible moves (which are shown on the screen). Reaching 3 stars at all levels can be a secondary goal. You can download the game from my personal Github: https://github.com/me50/ObliMario"

This game is based on real DNA dynamics, providing an engaging and educational experience. As you experiment with different combinations of genes, you will see how the characteristics of the animals evolve and change. The game is still in development, but I hope to add more features and content in the future."

When you open the practice screen, the verbs to study are shown. The app follows a flashcard model: it only shows the verb and asks you to think of the prepositions that go with it. By pressing 'Reveal prepositions,' the correct prepositions associated with the verb are displayed. When you tap on the card with the preposition, the meaning of the verb with that preposition is shown. From the verbs menu, you can search, modify, add, and delete any verb-preposition combination."

A second hit can be applied mid-flight, guided by hand position, to correct its trajectory. Players can teleport to the ball’s location and are required to launch it again from the same X and Z coordinates—though the launch height remains flexible. The main objective is to activate all the flowers distributed throughout the map. Falling into water resets the player to the starting point, adding a light layer of challenge. Planned features include a timer and shot counter to enable leaderboard rankings, as well as multiple themed levels. Designed as a calm yet engaging experience, this game allows players to relax and enjoy the environment while honing their aiming skills."
